I built an interactive dashboard focused on Kylian Mbappé — breaking down his performance across different seasons.
 The dashboard includes:
 
 🔹 Goals, assists & key contributions
 
 🔹 Minutes played and efficiency

 🔹 Season-to-season trends
 
 🔹 Visual comparisons and insights
 
This series is all about combining data storytelling with sports analytics.
Working on this helped me sharpen my skills in:

 ✔ Power BI design
 
 ✔ Data modeling & transformations
 
 ✔ Building meaningful visuals
