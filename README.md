Using a custom-built dataset, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights:

 🔹 Goals & assists per season

 🔹 Minutes played and efficiency ratios

 🔹 Contribution trends over time

 🔹 Season-to-season comparisons

The goal of this project was not just to display numbers, but to tell a clear story using data analytics and visualization. Working on this helped me strengthen my skills
